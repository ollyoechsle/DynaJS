### DynaJS
A bit of fun: a Bomberman clone written in JavaScript using as many HTML5 technologies as possible.

### Running
You run DynaJS from

web/index.html

### Building
Is via an Ant build. Ensure you have Apache Ant installed on your system, then enter (from the base directory):
ant

This will build a concatenated and minified JS file at web/javascript/prod/dyna-js-min.js

### Running the tests

To run the tests, first execute
```
$ ./test.sh (to start the JS Test Driver server)
```

Then:
```
$ ./run-tests.sh (to run the tests)
```

Currently the tests are set up for running against Firefox on an OSX box.
You may need to change the Firefox path to get it to run on your system.
